$ps -ef | grep -i DSD.RUN (respective job name) -> To find the process ID.

To use Datastage command line(universe shell)
$../dsenv
$bin/uvsh

To Kill a job,
>LOGTO (Project name)
>LOGOUT -(process ID)

To clear the file or job lock issue,
>LIST.READU ALL
>LIST.READU EVERY
>UNLOCK INODE(inode number) ALL 
>UNLOCK USER(user number) ALL

To fix corrupted job issue,
>CLEAR.FILE RT_LOG(XX)
>CLEAR.FILE DATA RT_LOG(XX)

When trying to clear a job lock from UV you see the error Verb "Unlock" is not in your VOC. So we need the UNLOCK command added to our Project VOC.
>set.file uv voc uv.voc 
>copy from uv.voc to voc unlock
>QUIT

When datastage file system becomes full or any system crash occurs. RT_LOGxxx files can become corrupted.

>DELETE.FILE DATA RT_LOG(xx) 
>CREATE.FILE DATA RT_LOG(xx)
DS_JOBS jobname -> To find job number

xx -> Job number
